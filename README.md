# Unit0TheBeginning - READ THIS FIRST

Hi fellow Taft APCS Principles workshop colleagues.  I cannot say enough how great it has been to share this week's experience with you.  Jackie ... my goodness!  I cannot recall learning so much in such a short period of time ... with such great people all while having FUN!!!  (Sorry - I cannot recall the hexidecimal equivalent for FUN at this very moment)

THANK YOU!!!!

Now onto the project ...

Welcome to Github.

In essence, what you have here is my Day one assignment with links to my Google Presentation for Day 1.

The purpose of this little demonstration is to assist me with my overall classroom workflow / assignment distribution and collection / student communication and feedback / and file management process.

My experience with GitHub is still in the infanccy stage, however, it is my goal to eventually use GitHub as my primary platform for these purposes.  Once you start exploring as I have you may agree ... GitHub is an industry and educational winner!!!

I also suggest you view the **Issues** and **Project** tabs.  I am very new to this, however, it looks like a great way to enhance the workflow management. 

Finally I have given you access to a file with several GitHub resources and videos that I have relied upon to teach myself this valuable tool.

I hope this adds some value along your journey bringing APCS Principles to your students.

Once again ...

Thanks so much for a great week!
