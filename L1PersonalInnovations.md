**Identify impacts and prototype an innovation - Brainstorm Technological Innovation**

People seem to say that technology is all around us, that it affects everything we do. Is that true? **Technological innovation** is about recognizing a problem that needs to be solved, or recognizing something needs improving and then building a tool to solve it.

As a class we’re going to see how innovative we can be. We’re going to do something called **“rapid prototyping.**”

**"Prototype"** is a fancy word that means a preliminary sketch of an idea or model for something new. It’s the original drawing from which something real might be built or created.


For each individual's area of interest:

Identify some way that technology is used with, or affects that thing.

Make a suggestion for either:

  1.    a way that technology might be improved to make it better, faster, easier to use
  2.    a creative or innovative new technology might help solve some problem within that area, or at least make better?
Everyone in the group should make suggestions for any of the areas of interest at your table.
