_What could you teach somebody?_

**Brainstorm Technological Innovation**

For each individual's area of interest:

Identify some way that technology is used with, or affects that thing.

Make a suggestion for either:

  1.    a way that technology might be improved to make it better, faster, easier to use
  2.    a creative or innovative new technology might help solve some problem within that area, or at least make better?
Everyone in the group should make suggestions for any of the areas of interest at your table.
